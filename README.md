# Kovalee-SDK
KovaleeSDK is an efficient iOS framework, that's packed with tools specifically for tracking user behavior, handling user purchases, and smoothly integrating ads.

We all know that integrating tracking tools can feel like solving a Rubik's cube. The hurdles of Apple's restrictions and the hoops we jump through with third-party frameworks make the process complex and time-consuming.

We've tackled this issue head-on at Kovalee. `KovaleeSDK` is our answer - a framework designed to handle the heavy lifting, automating many of the typically tedious steps and wrapping much of the tracking functionality into the SDK.

`KovaleeSDK` is split into multiple modules, distributed through SPM, each one taking care of a different area. 
- KovaleeAttribution
- KovaleePurchases
