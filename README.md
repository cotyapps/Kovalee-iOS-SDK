# Kovalee-SDK
KovaleeSDK is an efficient iOS framework, that's packed with tools specifically for tracking user behavior, handling user purchases, and smoothly integrating ads.

We all know that integrating tracking tools can feel like solving a Rubik's cube. The hurdles of Apple's restrictions and the hoops we jump through with third-party frameworks make the process complex and time-consuming.

We've tackled this issue head-on at Kovalee. `KovaleeSDK` is our answer - a framework designed to handle the heavy lifting, automating many of the typically tedious steps and wrapping much of the tracking functionality into the SDK.

`KovaleeSDK` is split into multiple modules, distributed through SPM, each one taking care of a different area. 
- KovaleeAttribution
- KovaleePurchases
- KovaleeRemoteConfig

## **Installation**

### 📦 **Swift Package**
The package can be simply installed as a dependency from XCode.

- Add a package by selecting `File` → `Add Packages…` in Xcode’s menu bar.
- Search for the Kovalee iOS SDK using the repo's URL:
  ```console
  https://github.com/cotyapps/Kovalee-iOS-SDK
  ```
- Set the **Dependency Rule** to be `Up to Next Major Version`.
- Select **Add Package**. 
  
And you are good to go.

## Integration
To properly work, this Package needs a set of configurations files that should be created by the team @Kovalee.

## Amplitude Session Replay

KovaleeSDK supports [Amplitude Session Replay](https://amplitude.com/docs/session-replay), which lets you capture and replay user sessions to better understand user behavior in your app.

### Enabling Session Replay

To enable Amplitude Session Replay, set `enableAmplitudeSessionReplay` to `true` in your `Configuration`:

```swift
Kovalee.initialize(
    configuration: Configuration(
        environment: .production,
        enableAmplitudeSessionReplay: true
    )
)
```

Session Replay is disabled by default. When enabled, the SDK automatically adds the `AmplitudeSwiftSessionReplayPlugin` to the Amplitude instance, and session replays will be available in your Amplitude dashboard.
